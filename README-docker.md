# Running the APIs in Docker
You can develop and test against the entire set of dependencies for the Django APIs using a Docker container.

This reduces the amount of software you'll have to install and keep running correctly on your system, and improve your ability to stay current with your fellow developers.

## Prerequisites
You'll need to install two pieces of software:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Mac Users
If you're running Mac OS X on a MacBook from 2010 or later, the install for both of these is simple:
- download the Docker DMG file [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- install and you're ready to go!

### Windows Users (and ancient Macs)
If you're running an older MacBook, or running Windows, see [here](https://github.com/hackoregon/devops-17/blob/master/HOWTO%20Guides/HOWTO-Docker-on-OSX-with-Docker-Toolbox.md) for instructions on using the Docker Toolkit and still get the same basic experience.

### Linux Users
If you're running a friendly Linux:
- installing Docker - try one of these links [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) (Note: we've never tried this - send us feedback on the #dev-ops channel)
- installing Docker Compose - use the `curl` command you'll find [here](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)

Ping us if you need instructions on installing Docker on Linux.

## Build the Docker container
At present, each developer builds the Docker container on their own computer.  (In the future, based on demand, we may pre-build the container image and enable developers to download the latest stable image.)

Here's how:

1. clone the current repo to your local system (or `git pull` if you already have it cloned and just need to update to latest code)
2. run `cd team-budget` (i.e. into the folder where you find the repo)
3. run `cp ./budget_proj/bin/env-template.sh ./budget_proj/bin/env.sh`
4. run `./budget_proj/bin/start-proj.sh -l`
    - Note: this script already includes the `--build` parameter for `docker-compose`, so that if you've made changes to the Django code or anything else used by Docker to build the container, Docker will include the changes made since the last start (build) of the container

Once the container is running, you can browser or query the API endpoints at http://127.0.0.1:8000/budget.  (If you're using **Docker Toolbox**, they'll be available at http://192.168.99.100:8000/budget instead).

## How can you troubleshoot the app or other bits in the container?

Sometimes you'll have to troubleshoot the server - look at log files, look for a missing file, whatever.

This is when you can use the Docker cli:

```
docker exec -it [container_id or name] /bin/bash
```

(Getting the container_id or name for the running Docker container is easy - just run `docker ps`.)
