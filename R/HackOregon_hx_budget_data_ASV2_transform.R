# This R code transforms a CSV file of historical Portland Budget data.
# Execute the script by sourcing the file in an R shell:
#   > source("./HackOregon_hx_budget_data_ASV2_transform.R")
# or by executing the code line-by-line within RStudio.
#
# Assumptions:
# The working directory is the top-level of the 'team-budget' project.
#   See https://github.com/hackoregon/team-budget/ for the directory
#   structure of the project.
# The originally extracted data has column headers like, 'FY 2014-15', with
#   monetary amounts in those columns. Those columns need to be transformed to
#   two columns:
#     (a) 'fiscal_year' with values like '2014-15'.
#     (b) 'amount' column with monetary amounts.
#
# Limitations:
# This is not a generalized function. It is meant to work with one
#   specific data extract and we are executing the code interactively
#   in an R shell. If future extracts follow the same format,
#   then maybe this code can be generalized into a packaged function
#   for transforming the extracts. For now, it is intended to be used
#   once, but we documented it, so that the transformations are clear.
#   And we hope that it can be generalized and reused in the future.
#
# References:
# This code is derived from:
#   https://github.com/smithjd/hack_or_budget/blob/master/tidy_spreadsheet.R
