# Running the APIs in Docker
You can develop and test against the entire set of dependencies for the Django APIs using a Docker container.

This reduces the amount of software you'll have to install and keep running correctly on your system, and improve your ability to stay current with your fellow developers.

## Prerequisites
You'll need to install two pieces of software:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

If you're running Mac OS X on a MacBook from 2010 or later, the install for both of these is simple:
- download the Docker DMG file [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- install and you're ready to go!

If you're running an older MacBook, or running Windows, see [here](https://github.com/hackoregon/devops-17/blob/master/HOWTO%20Guides/HOWTO-Docker-on-OSX-with-Docker-Toolbox.md) for instructions on using the Docker Toolkit and still get the same basic experience.

If you're running a friendly Linux:
- installing Docker - try one of these links [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) (Note: we've never tried this - send us feedback on the #dev-ops channel)
- installing Docker Compose - use the `curl` command you'll find [here](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)

Ping us if you need instructions on installing Docker on Linux.

## Build the Docker container
At present, each developer will have to build the docker container on their own computer.  (In the future, based on demand, we may pre-build the container image and enable developers to download the latest.)

Here's how:

- clone the current repo to your local system (or `git pull` if you already have it cloned and just need to update to latest code)
- `cd team-budget/budget_proj/` (i.e. into the folder where you find `Dockerfile`)
- run `docker-compose up --build` 
    - if you're launching it for the first time, you can merely run `docker-compose up`
    - otherwise, if you've made changes to the Django code or anything else used by Docker to build the container, the `--build` parameter makes sure that Docker includes any changes made since the last build of the container

Once the container is running, you'll find the API endpoints at http://127.0.0.1:8000.  (If you're using Docker Toolbox, they'll be available at  http://192.168.99.100:8000 instead).

## How can you interrogate the running server in the container?

Sometimes you'll have to troubleshoot the server - look at log files, look for a missing file, whatever.

This is when you use the Docker cli:

```
docker exec -it [container_id or name] /bin/bash
```

(Getting the container_id or name for the running Docker container is easy - just run `docker ps`)
